# Development Process Report

## Project Development and Workload Distribution
**Team Members:** Tibet Atakan, Yigit Uyanik, and Gokhan Korkut

### Smart Contract Development
We adopted a unique approach to smart contract development by having each team member write their own smart contracts using different Gen-AI assistance tools:
- Cursor
- Chat-GPT
- Claude AI

This strategy was chosen to:
- Help each team member understand the essentials of smart contract design
- Enable individual creativity and learning
- Generate diverse perspectives on contract implementation

After individual development, we conducted in-person meetings to:
- Discuss alternative smart contracts
- Compare different implementations
- Build final contracts by combining the best ideas
- Select the simplest and most effective designs

### Frontend Development
As none of our team members had prior experience with graphic UI design, we leveraged Gen-AI tools to:
- Realize our design ideas
- Create a user-friendly interface
- Implement our vision for the project

The frontend development process was collaborative, with each team member:
- Contributing design ideas
- Iterating on the UI
- Working together until we achieved a satisfactory design

### Documentation and Presentation
The final phase of the project was distributed as follows:

1. **Gokhan Korkut**
   - Created the video presentation of the project
   - Designed the general UI concept for the frontend

2. **Tibet Atakan**
   - Developed the detailed README.md file
   - Included comprehensive setup instructions

3. **Yigit Uyanik**
   - Wrote this development process report
   - Added detailed comments in the smart contracts

This distribution of responsibilities ensured that each team member could contribute their strengths to the project's success while maintaining clear documentation and presentation materials.
