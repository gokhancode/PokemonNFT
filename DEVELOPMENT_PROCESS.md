We are writing this document to report the development process of this project and the distribution of the workload among the group members Tibet Atakan, Yigit Uyanik and Gokhan Korkut. 

Firstly, we decided that all members of our group write their own smart contracts using three different Gen-AI assistance, namely Cursor, Chat-GPT and Claude AI. This aimed to help each of us to understand the essentials of smart contract design and enable more individual creativity. Afterwards, we met in person and discussed the alternative smart contracts and built final contracts taking the best ideas and simplest designs from different implementations. 

None of our group members had experience with graphic UI design so for the frontend development part we used Gen-AI tools to realize our design ideas. This is done by each member of our team adding design ideas until we reach a UI that satisfies our needs and wishes. 

Finally we shared the documentation and presentation part as follows: Gokhan Korkut did the video presentation of the project, Tibet Atakan created the detailed README.md file with setup instructions and Yigit Uyanik wrote this report and the detailed comments in the smart contracts.We are writing this document to report the development process of this project and the distribution of the workload among the group members Tibet Atakan, Yigit Uyanik and Gokhan Korkut.
