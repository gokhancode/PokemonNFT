# 3-Minute Project Presentation Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello everyone, I'm Gökhan Korkut, and today I'll be presenting our Pokemon NFT Trading Platform project, developed together with Tibet Atakan and Yiğit Uyanık. This is a decentralized application that allows users to mint, trade, and manage Pokemon-Card like NFTs on the blockchain."

[SHOW: Project homepage on screen]

## Development Approach (45 seconds)
"Our team took an innovative approach to development. Each team member - Tibet, Yigit, and myself - wrote smart contracts using different AI tools:
- Cursor
- Chat-GPT
- Claude AI

This helped us understand smart contract development from different perspectives. We then combined the best ideas into our final implementation."

## Key Features (45 seconds)
"Let me demonstrate the main features:
1. NFT Minting: Users can mint unique Pokemon NFTs thanks to our randomized Pokemon stats
2. Trading System: Secure peer-to-peer trading of NFTs via auctions or direct listings. 
3. User Dashboard: Easy management of owned NFTs"

[DEMONSTRATE: 
- Connect wallet
- Show minting process
- Display trading interface]

## Technical Implementation (30 seconds)
"The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, while our smart contracts are deployed on the Sepolia testnet. We used OpenZeppelin for secure contract implementations. To ensure reliability, we developed a comprehensive test suite covering deployment, minting, trading, and ownership verification."

## Team Collaboration (30 seconds)
"For documentation, we divided responsibilities:
- I created the video presentation and UI design
- Tibet handled the README and setup instructions
- Yigit wrote the development report and contract comments to increase readability"

## Presentation Tips:
1. Have the application running before starting
2. Keep the demo focused on key features
3. Be ready to show the code if asked
4. Have a backup plan if live demo fails
5. Practice the timing beforehand
